## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4 phases derived from 22 requirements; auth first because all 7 critical pitfalls live there
- [Roadmap]: UIUX-01 and UIUX-02 placed in Phase 1 (shell-level concerns, not feature-level)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Auth.js v5 beta stability -- monitor, but Zitadel docs use it as reference implementation
- [Phase 1]: Zod 4 + @hookform/resolvers compatibility -- verify at project setup, fall back to Zod 3.24.x if needed
- [Phase 2]: Zitadel service account provisioning needed for Management API access -- operational prerequisite
