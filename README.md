Info / Roadmap

I’m currently refactoring main_plugin.py and related folders to improve the project structure—moving classes into smaller, modular components.

After the refactor is complete, I’ll be adding:

The ability to attach devices to any map element (e.g., splitters, routers, etc.)

A Fiber Splicing Manager

An Optical Fiber Diagram generator/viewer

Open-Source Fiber Network Design Plugin for QGIS
